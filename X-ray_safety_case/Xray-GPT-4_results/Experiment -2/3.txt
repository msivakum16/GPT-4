G1: Demonstrate that the X-ray backscattering machine at an airport is acceptably safe, particularly ensuring no overradiation occurs.
S1: Provide evidence and arguments for two main aspects: software operation safety and timer interlock operation safety.
G2: Ensure software operation of the X-ray machine is safe and error-free.
Sn1: Formal verification results of the software.
Sn2: Testing results of the software under various scenarios.
G3: Ensure the timer interlock operation is reliable and prevents overexposure.
Sn3: Fault tree analysis results for the timer interlock system.
Sn4: Testing results of the timer interlock under failure scenarios.
A1: The testing environments for software and timer interlock systems accurately represent operational conditions.
J1: The combination of formal verification and extensive testing provides a comprehensive assessment of potential failure modes and their mitigations.
C1: Information about the operational environment of the X-ray backscattering machine, such as airport security checkpoints.
C2: Regulatory standards for radiation exposure and safety measures in such machines.
