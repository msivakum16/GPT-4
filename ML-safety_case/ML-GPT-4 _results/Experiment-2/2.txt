G1: Justify that the ML algorithm for the TNR system is acceptably safe with respect to functional insufficiencies leading to False Positives (FP) in dry road surface condition identification.
S1: Demonstrate fulfillment of technical requirements and effective handling of safety-relevant misclassifications (FP).
G2: Prove that the ML algorithm meets functional safety requirement (FSR x): "The TNR shall not provide the result dry in case of a non-dry road surface (ASIL B)."
G3: Demonstrate robustness and generalization capabilities of the ML algorithm.
G4: Validate the algorithm's real-time processing capabilities and its ability to filter sampling anomalies.
S2: Use evidence from various methods to support the safety argument.
Sn1: Results from structured testing, including test cases covering all known properties and specific corner cases.
Sn2: Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the ML model and expert reviews of generated prototypes.
Sn3: Simulation results demonstrating the algorithm's performance in varied conditions, including signal noise.
C1: The TNR system uses microphones within the wheel housing to classify road surface conditions as dry or not dry, influencing vehicle-level functions like chassis control and powertrain systems.
A1: The domain model used in testing accurately represents real-world conditions and properties influencing the TNR system's performance.
J1: The focus on FP (predicted dry while actually not dry) is justified as it is the only safety-relevant misclassification, with False Negatives (FN) leading to conservative but safe control strategies.
