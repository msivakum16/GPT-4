G1: The ML algorithm for TNR is acceptably safe for vehicle use.
C1: TNR uses ML to classify road surface conditions.
C2: TNR improves vehicle-level functions like chassis control and powertrain systems.
C3: Dryness is defined as a road surface without any materials between tyre and road surface.
S1: Argument by demonstrating compliance with technical requirements and ISO 26262 standards.
A1: All relevant safety concerns for the ML algorithm are identified.
A2: The ML algorithm's runtime properties and signal processing capabilities meet real-time requirements.
G2: The ML algorithm accurately identifies 'dry' and '!dry' road conditions.
C4: Accuracy is defined in terms of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
S2: Argument by verification and validation of the ML algorithm.
Sn1: Analysis of ML algorithm's strengths and weaknesses.
Sn2: Simulation results using synthetic and recorded data.
Sn3: Results from structured testing covering all known properties.
Sn4: Field test results on real roads.
